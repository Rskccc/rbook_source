# Final Project


## What is it?

In this class, you are expected to formulate groups with your classmates,
work as a group on a data analysis project using what you learn from the
class (and beyond) about **R**, generate a analysis report, and present as a
group your report in the last week.


## What are the project options?

Ideally, the projects will be based on *real* tasks you have from your
research or daily work.

Several options will also be suggested to you *only if* your group has
difficulty identifying an appropriate topic.


## What needs to be in the report?

The report should consider including the following sections:

-   Background
    -   Introduction of the project
-   Goal
    -   Research question(s) the analysis aims to answer
-   Data
    -   Description of the data
    -   Data cleaning and manipulation steps
    -   Data summary and visualization
-   Analysis
    -   Methods applied in the analysis
-   Results and summary
    -   Report your findings


## How should the report be formatted?

-   Use **R Markdown** for conducting your analysis and generating the report.
-   You report may be included in this **R for Cancer Research** book!
-   An example is provided in the next chapter


## Recommendations

-   Try things out in R
    -   You should make a real effort to practice what was covered in class
        in a complete project that includes reading in data, doing something
        intentional to it and reporting the results of that analysis in an
        organized way.
-   Write up your methods and results
    -   In addition to your code, the report should also be a well-written document
        that clearly summarizes the analysis, and presents results in a
        logical and readable way. Plots should have meaningful labels, and
        should incorporate such elements as color, multiple plotting symbols,
        and legends as necessary for clarity. Summary statistics should be
        rounded to a relevant number of significant digits, etc&#x2026;
-   Submit clean, well commented code
    -   Code should employ self-documenting
        variable names, and include comments as needed so that a collaborator
        could follow it easily.
-   Reproducibility
    -   This means that we, with the same files in an appropriately named
        directory, can reproduce your final results simply by rendering your
        R markdown file.
    -   You will find it easier to produce clean code if you designate a
        discrete work space for the project, and keep everything there,
        always work from a script you write rather than working interactively
        at the R-prompt, organize your code into logical sections, and
        annotate your code with comments so you can keep track of what each
        chunk is supposed to do.
